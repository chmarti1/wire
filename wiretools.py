# Grid definition #
#=================#

class Grid:
    """GRID CLASS
The GRID class is responsible for defining a uniform two-dimensional
grid of nodes and elements for performing the wire current deconvolution
operation.  In a uniform 2D grid, the elements are squares with four
member nodes comprising the vertices of the element.

:: Definitions ::

NODE: A node is a point in space at which the wire current density, J 
    will be approximated explicitly.  The values at all points sur-
    rounding the node will be approximated by interpolation between the 
    surrounding nodes.  See ELEMENT.
    
    Nodes may be indexed by their sequential order from left-to-right 
    then bottom-to-top such or by their column, row coordinates.

ELEMENT: An element is a region of space wherein the values of current 
    density, J, at points in the region can be approximated by interpo-
    lation between the element's member nodes.  In a uniform grid, the
    elements are squares with four member nodes forming the corners of
    the element.  

:: Defining a Grid ::

A grid is defined by its number of nodes in the x- and y-axes and their 
spacing, delta.  The Grid length scale unit system is determined entire-
ly by the choice of units for delta.  If delta is specified in inches, 
then all length scales should be regarded in inches, all areas should be
interpreted as in^2, and all current densities should be interpreted as
Amperes per in^2.  

>>> G = Grid(Nx, Ny, delta)

The properties of the grid and its spacing may be retrieved and modified
by directly referencing the N and delta members.  N is a two-element 
integer numpy array that is equivalent to (Nx,Ny).  The following 
examples generate a grid with 200 horizontal nodes and 150 vertical 
nodes with 0.05 unit length spacing.

>>> G = Grid(200, 150, .05)

    OR
>>> G = Grid(2,2,1)
>>> G.N[0] = 200
>>> G.N[1] = 150
>>> G.N
np.array([200, 150])
>>> G.delta = .05

:: Node Coordinate System ::

Nodes are indexed either sequentially with a single index, n, or by 
column-and-row pair, (i,j).  The node at the smallest x,y coordinate
(usually regarded as bottom,left) is n=0 or i,j=(0,0).  Sequential ind-
exing proceeds along the x-axis first (row) and resumes at the next row.
A 3x3 grid would have an index table:
i   j   n
---------
0   0   0
1   0   1
2   0   2
0   1   3
1   1   4
2   1   5
... and so on ...

The grid is arranged so that nodes with i=0 are on the y-axis (at x=0) 
and symmetrically about the x-axis, so that j=0 are at negative y-coord-
inates.  A node's x,y coordinates can be calculated from the i,j indices
    x = i*delta
    y = (j - (Ny-1)/2.0)*delta
    
The following member methods are utilities for interacting with the
coordinate system
    size        Calculate the number of nodes N[0] * N[1]
    ij_to_n     Convert from (i,j) to n indexing
    n_to_ij     Convert from n to (i,j) indexing
    node        Returns the x,y coordintes of a node

:: Element Coordinate System ::

Elements are indexed identically to nodes, except that they have one
fewer row and one fewer column.  To make the sequential node indexing
more intuitive, we will ignore the last column and the last column of 
elements.  In this way, each element shares the same indexing scheme
with one of its nodes (the bottom-left node).

The following member methods interact with the grid elements
    esize   Calculate the number of elements (N[0]-1)*(N[1]-1)
    eN      Returns the element dimensions
    element Returns the x,y coordinates of the four element nodes
    
:: Physical Size ::

The dimensions of the grid's domain are delta*(Nx-1), delta*(Ny-1).
This is returned by the dims funciton.
